# Google-Smartphone-Decimeter-Challenge

During my Summer 2021 internship at Falcon Trading, I participated in the Google Smartphone Decimeter Challenge.

I developed a GPS algorithm in Python using a weighted least squares regression with Bayesian optimization to solve the satellite trilateration problem. I applied an adaptive gauss filter and outlier correction for postprocessing of the calculated positions. Using this code, I placed 108th out of 810 on the public leaderboard.
