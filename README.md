# Google-Smartphone-Decimeter-Challenge

During my Summer 2021 internship at Falcon Trading, I participated in the Google Smartphone Decimeter Challenge.

I implemented a weighted least squares regression with Bayesian optimization to improve Google's GPS algo-
rithm, placing 108th out of 810 on the public leaderboard.
